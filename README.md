ML-Computer Vision Enthusiast
-----------------------------

I have started learning coding when I was offered a position as Student Research Assistant @ University of Siegen (Siegen, DE), where my responsibilites were to make programms and write codes for different projects in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Data Science and Deep Learning. In the meantime, to enhance knowledge and understanding of various concepts, I undertook plethora of courses. Eventually, the interest got deepen so well that it started craving to learn more and I ended up doing internship @ U-Glow Gmbh (Mülheim, North Rhine-Westphalia, DE) as Machine Learning intern. I joined this industrial research project focused on developing an Energy optimization toolchain. I was responsible for designing a pipeline that pre-processes and detects anomalies by applying unsupervised machine learning algorithms. After having significant experience, I wrote my Master Thesis @ Fraunhofer IMS (Duisburg, DE) on the topic "Contactless determination of Valsalva Maneuver". The aim of the thema was to warn people who often performs this breathing maneuver very often.
